    It would be hard to imagine my first year at college without the experience I was given through PLTW. Made possibly by the strict, but incredible teachers at Middleton High School, I came into college with a passion for robotics engineering and a repository of knowledge that allowed me to better acclimate to the class climate and expectations.

    Classes such as Computer Integrated Manufacturing and Principals of Engineering gave me the basis upon which all of my knowledge gained during the past two years in college has been built upon. Additionally, the capstone Engineering Design and Development course gave me an appreciation for good product design, and how to solve real world problems through engineered solutions.
