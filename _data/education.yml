    During my time at WPI so far, I have expanded my knowledge and capabilities beyond what I had expected for my first two years. While well designed, challenging classes have aided in this, the college environment where I have been completely immersed has also been incredibly beneficial. I am constantly surrounded by people I can learn from, better my skills, and reciprocate these.

    The coursework at WPI has helped me refine the skills I came to the school with, as well as gain many additional things to add to my 'toolbox'. It has been enlightening to learn just *how much* there is I don't know, and what I will hopefully accomplish in the next 2 years.
