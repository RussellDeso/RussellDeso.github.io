    As the senior mentor of 3 robotics teams, I used the knowledge gained during my previous engineering classes, as well as previous years in robotics in order to aid our school's teams with any issues they might have, as well as just helping them get going at the start of seasons.

    Additionally, I was the lead mechanical designer for one of our FTC teams, having designed multiple iterations of our robot in CAD, performing a cost analysis on each and leading in the manufacturing of custom machined parts.

    All of the school's teams are world class, and in particular, the 2 teams I was most involved with went to the World Championship multiple times during my time on those teams.
