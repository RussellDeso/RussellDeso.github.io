    Proclaimed as one of the hardest courses offered at WPI, the Software Engineering course challenges students to create a full-scale JavaFX application in a competitive, team environment.

    This course had 10-person student teams working in a class competition to apply Agile development methodologies and software design patterns in Java to create an indoor pathfinding application, map builder, room scheduler, and integrated service request modules for Brigham & Women’s Faulkner Hospital. The software systems that student teams created were to inform Brigham & Women’s Hospital about potential features, user interfaces, or design approaches that they might consider implementing.

    As the Project Manager of our team of 10 developers, I employed the AGILE Scrum methodology to keep our team on track during our 1 week sprints. Each sprint involved bug fixing, general improvements, and a couple of new, technically adept features. As project manager, I organized our team's work backlog during the week in order to keep ourselves on track, as the fast pace of the course and the sheer workload can make it easy to fall behind before the next sprint.

    In addition to managing the rest of the team, I also developed my own parts of the application, and singlehandedly revamped the entire user interface in the most recent sprint. Other components that I have worked on include a 'service request' feature, which interacts with the internal database, a powerful floor by floor directory, and most of the initial user interface designed with FXML.

    Over the course of this project, I have become confident in the use of JavaFX (Through Scenebuilder and by hand), Java class structure and design patterns, Git and Github, IntelliJ IDE, and Gradle.

    Alongside these technical skills, I also became more proficient in time management, team organization, and 'people skills', using many organizational tools to accomplish the former tasks, while being heavily involved with the team and team dynamics for the latter.

    In the first iteration of the project, our team won 2nd place for our application and presentation. In the most recent iteration, which was in a 'Shark Tank' format presentation, our team received a perfect score.

    The Great Problems Seminar is a first year course that gets freshman students into the mindset of solving real world issues using research, nuance, and an engineered solution.

    During the second half of GPS, students form groups in order to solve a problem of their choosing. Our group of 8 decided to tackle food insecurity in cities in the United States. Throughout the term, we researched, interviewed, and discussed what the underlying problems really were before we began to implement our solution.

    Using my experience with mechanical design, we came up with a physical 'product' that would allow people in affected communities to be able to grow their own food cheaply and easily, in order to provide a source of fresh produce. Additionally, I designed and iterated upon our team's logo which helped to further my graphic design experience.
